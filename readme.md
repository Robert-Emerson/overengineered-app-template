# Description

Template for a modern, over-engineered web app that uses containers and service mesh for no reason other than because it can (and because I want to get a bit more experience with 'em)

## Dependencies

- Docker runtime (Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop)
- Make
- .NET 8 (nice to have; container is set up to build for you)

## Running

- `make api` - runs the API
- `make watch` - runs the API and watches for file changes
- `make down` - stops running containers; removes containers
- `make clean` - stops running containers; removes containers; deletes custom images
- `make certs` - generates a self-signed cert for `localhost` to enable TLS and mTLS between client and gateway, and gateway and sidecars

## What's next

1. JWT Auth for API
   1. API JWT validation
2. Parameterize `todo-proxy.yaml` > `api-proxy.yaml`
3. Logging
   1. OTel in API
   2. Apache Skywalking? or maybe Jaeger/Prometheus/Grafana
4. Unit & Integration Tests
5. Database
6. SPA
7. Actually write down a roadmap
   - Future issues:
     - ECC certs instead of RSA
     - SDS for certificate rotation
8. Mess around with AMPQ/Kafka
9. Mess around with gRPC/Thrift/RPC
